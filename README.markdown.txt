NDC2010
=======

This is a MonoTouch iPhone app aiming to continue the trend of developers in the MonoTouch community building iPhone apps for developer conferences, following in the footsteps of the Mix10 app.

The NDC2010 iPhone app currently has the ability to list all sessions by day, and drill down to a screen showing information about each session. It also has a list of speakers, with the ability to drill down and find information on each speaker. Finally, the app has the ability to fetch the RSS Twitter feed for the #NDC2010 hashtag.
